- 👋 Hi, I’m @SGtrinkets
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, graphics programming and learning in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, OpenGL, game development with Godot, and am pursuing a Bachelor's degree at PUCMM in the Dominican Republic.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fixing errors on big projects (desperately need the experience), adding new features, game development big or small, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
